Introduction This repository contains a script to manage sales data in a SQL database, along with a visualization component. It automates the creation of a sales table if not already existing, inserts dummy sales data for testing purposes, and performs SQL queries to aggregate total quantity and revenue per product. Additionally, it generates a bar chart to visualize revenue by product for better insights.

Features: Automated Setup: Creates the sales table if not already present in the database.

Data Insertion: Inserts dummy sales data to populate the table for testing and development.

SQL Aggregation: Calculates total quantity and revenue per product using SQL queries.

Visualization: Generates a bar chart depicting revenue distribution across different products.

Purpose: This project aims to provide a streamlined solution for managing and analyzing sales data using SQL databases. It's ideal for developers and data analysts looking to quickly set up and visualize sales metrics within their applications.

Requirements: SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) configured and accessible.

Python environment with appropriate SQL libraries installed.

Getting Started: To begin using this script:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Ensure your SQL database is set up and accessible.

Configure the database connection parameters in the script.

Run the script to create the table, insert dummy data, and visualize sales metrics.

For detailed instructions and customization options, refer to the documentation provided in the repository.
